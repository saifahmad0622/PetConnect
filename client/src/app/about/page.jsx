                <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-blue-400">Our Story</h2>
                <p className="text-base text-gray-100 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    PetConnect was founded by a passionate group of animal lovers who saw firsthand the challenges faced by pets in shelters. With a vision to create a more efficient way to connect pets with potential adopters, we established this platform. Our journey began with a simple idea: to make pet adoption accessible and straightforward for everyone. Over the years, we have partnered with numerous shelters and rescue organizations to create a network that facilitates successful adoptions.
